# TLS/SSL

### Serving Next.js locally with HTTPS

-   [Vercel: Discussion on how to use Next.js over HTTPS instead of HTTP](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/10935)
    -   Working setup
        -   https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert
        -   https://github.com/cameronhunter/local-ssl-proxy
-   [Alternative way to use Next.js over HTTPS, using `devcert` and overriding Next server start-up](https://waltergalvao.dev/how-to-set-up-local-ssl-with-nextjs)
    -   did not work as-is, would need more investigation in local server start-up script
    -   `devcert` seems nice though
